## Status

We are still in an exploration phase. Technically the foundation for hosting a podcast with a valid RSS feed is there but it's very simplistic and missing features left and right. Using this in production is not recommended yet as breaking changes will occur without prior notice.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
